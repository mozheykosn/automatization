# automatization

**Project** - Yandex.Dzen article portal.
**Objective** - automate the analysis of user interaction with article cards for managers.

Each card is defined by its topic and source (which also has a topic). Examples of topics: "Beauty and Health," "Russia," "Travel." Users of the system are characterized by age categories. For example, "26-30" or "45+."

Let's answer the following questions:
 - How many user interactions with cards occur in the system, broken down by card topics?
 - How many cards do sources generate with different topics?
 - How do the topics of cards relate to the topics of sources?
